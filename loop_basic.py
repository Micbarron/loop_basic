# Prob 1 print integers from 1 - 150

# for x in range (0,101):
#     print(x)

# Prob 2print multiples of 5 from 5 to 1000

# for x in range (5,1005, 5):
#     print(x)

# Prob 3 print integers 1 - 100 if divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisble by 10, print "Coding Dojo"

# for x in range(0,101):
#     if x % 10 == 0:
#         print("CodingDojo")
#     elif x % 5 == 0:
#         print("Coding")
#     else:
#         print(x)

# Prob 4 add odd integers from 0 to 500000, and print the final sum

# count = 0
# for x in range(0,500001):
#     if x % 2 == 1:
#         count += x
# print(count)

# Prob 5 print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

# for x in range(2018, 0, -4):
#     print(x)

# Prob 6 Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# lowNum = 4
# highNum = 500
# mult = 6
# for x in range(lowNum, highNum, mult):
#     print(x)
